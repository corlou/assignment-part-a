## Question 1: Description of your website

#### Problem and Solution (aka Purpose):

When it comes to yoga, there is a standard of move names. No matter where you are in the world, all students and teachers can identify the poses.

However, when it comes to pole fitness, move names vary wildly from studio to studio (with the exception of famous moves).

**Solution: Create a dictionary of pole moves with images and names.**

#### Target Audience:

This app will focus on a small studio in Brisbane, Csolta Pole Studio, that has mixed level classes. The target audience will be the teacher and students of Csolta. The teacher uses her phone to search for moves to teach but there is no history of moves she has taught. Furthermore, students can't remember what they have learnt and aren't able to search online because of the different names.

#### Functionality/Features:

##### Teacher

- Login as a teacher, who is also the administrator.
- Search for a move and view the list of moves.
- Add a move to a class.
- Delete a move from a class.

##### Student

- Login as a student.
- Search moves.
- View moves added to their class.

##### Nice to have:

- Allow students to mark moves as a 'favourite', and view the favourite moves under their profile.
- Add checkboxes for confidence level - a teacher can then use this information for future class planning

#### Tech Stack:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- React Bootstrap for styling
- Node.js
